# GitOps-ArgoCD-Tetris-Game

This repository demonstrates how to use ArgoCD for GitOps to deploy and manage a Tetris game on a Kubernetes single-node cluster. This project highlights testing various versions of the Tetris game in a streamlined and automated manner.

## Overview

GitOps is a modern approach to managing Kubernetes clusters and application delivery. By using ArgoCD, we can automate the deployment, management, and synchronization of applications based on the state defined in a Git repository.

In this project:

- ArgoCD is utilized as the GitOps tool.
- A Tetris game is deployed to a Kubernetes single-node cluster.
- Multiple versions of the Tetris game are tested.

## Features

- **ArgoCD Integration**: Automates application deployment and ensures the Kubernetes cluster matches the desired state defined in Git.
- **Version Management**: Easily deploy and test different versions of the Tetris game.
- **Single-Node Cluster**: Designed for simplicity, running on a single-node Kubernetes cluster for development and testing purposes.



## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install and Configure ArgoCD

1. Install ArgoCD in your Kubernetes cluster:
